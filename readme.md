weechat-ircrypt
===============

This is the reference implementation of the [IRCrypt
protocol](https://github.com/IRCrypt/documentation). It provides an encryption
layer for IRC using standardized and well proven techniques for encryption.

This plug-in can be used for *Weechat*. It is still work-in-progress, but can
already be used to send and receive messages encrypted with cryptographically
strong symmetric ciphers.

Requirements:

 - Weechat with support for Python extensions
 - GnuPG
